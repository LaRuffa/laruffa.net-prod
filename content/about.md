<h2>A little about me</h2>
Hi! I'm Mike. Welcome to my site.

I'm a tech-geek that loves to learn and evolve. Currently I am employed as an on-prem systems administrator with the goal of transitioning into cloud engineering. I am currently enrolled in AZ-104 and AZ-500 courses on Udemy, and have obtained my AZ-900 this way. In my free time I love to play video games and work on personal projects to further my knowledge. Here are a few of the technologies I've worked with in my homelab.
<ul>
<li>VMWare Vcenter 7</li>
<li>Cube Coders AMP (Application Management Panel) not to be confused with Cisco's AMP (Endpoint security)</li>
</ul>
