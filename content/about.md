<h2>A little about me</h2>
Hi! I'm Mike. Welcome to my site.

I'm a tech-geek that loves to learn and evolve. Currently I am employed as an on-prem systems administrator with the goal of transitioning into cloud engineering. I am currently enrolled in AZ-104 and AZ-500 courses on Udemy, and have obtained my AZ-900 this way. In my free time I love to play video games and work on personal projects to further my knowledge. Here are a few of the technologies I've worked with in my homelab.
<ul>
<li>Pfsense - firewall/router, VPN. Love this software. Easy to use, and secure</li>
<li>VMWare Vcenter 7 - for persistent virtualization</li>
<li>Cube Coders AMP (Application Management Panel) not to be confused with Cisco's AMP (Endpoint security) - for easy docker based deployments for game servers</li>
<li>Wireguard - for reverse proxy via a VPS</li>
<li>Racknerd VPS - for site/game hosting, reverse proxy, and miscellaneous projects</li>
<li>Ubiquiti Flex 16 port - Got this before I was trained on Cisco products, but don't regret. Looks nice and easy to configure via GUI</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
</ul>

As many techies do, I have ventured down the Linux route before. I still use it from time to time, but moreso for curiousity than anything else. I can proudly say I prefer Windows as my daily driver, but have had intermediate experience in the following distributions:
<ul>
  <li>Arch - I love it with Hyperland, but not my favorite distribution. You need a lot of time to get things working the way you want, which I simply do not have.</li>
  <li><ul>Debian Based Distros</li>
  <li>Ubuntu - My favorite. Stable, and works out of the box for what I use it for.</li>
  <li>Kali - We've all had that "hacker phase" before. I like the OS, but at this point I'd rather just use Arch or Ubuntu and install the tools I need. Too much bloat in my opinion.</li>
  <li>Mint - Sweet mint.</li>
    <li>Pi OS - probably my least favorite distrobution of all time to be honest.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>RHEL - Have used both professionally and personally, no major complaints.</li>
</ul>
